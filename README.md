This is my solution for the Frontend Mentor challenge "Order summary component" challenge. https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj/hub/order-summary-component-Zgu1tLXuf

Users were instructed to build out an order summary card to match provided designed images, including a couple hover states.

This is my first Frontend Mentor challange and I really enjoyed it. I would say the main challenge for me was trying to copy the exact size of components. In this case I did it by eye but I suspect there are better methods out there. I think for just estimating I did pretty well.

I am not 100% satisfied with my design solution for transitioning from mobile to desktop sizing. The order summary switches from mobile sizing to desktop sizing at 768px. The desktop design was relatively small and narrow and as such I felt it made sense to transition to this size fairly quickly. What I do not like is that I didn't design a slower transition where the design just grows to fit. Instead there is an abrupt switch over. I think for most use cases the view screen would not likely be resized during use so the smoothness I am looking for might never be needed. Nonetheless, its not elegant.
