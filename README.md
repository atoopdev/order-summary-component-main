This is my solution for the Frontend Mentor challenge "Order summary component" challenge. https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj/hub/order-summary-component-Zgu1tLXuf

Users were instructed to build out an order summary card to match provided designed images, including a couple hover states.

This is my first Frontend Mentor challange and I really enjoyed it. I would say the main challenge for me was trying to copy the exact size of components. In this case I did it by eye but I suspect there are better methods out there.
